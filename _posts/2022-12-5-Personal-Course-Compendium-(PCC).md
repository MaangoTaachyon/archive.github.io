| ------------ | ------------ | --- | --- | 
| Certified Red Team Operator Courseware | "Students will first cover the core concepts of adversary simulation, command & control, engagement planning and reporting. They will then go through each stage of the attack lifecycle - from initial compromise to full domain takeover, data hunting and exfiltration. Students will learn how common "OPSEC failures" can lead to detection by defenders, and how to carry out those attacks in a stealthier way. Finally, they will learn how to bypass defences such as Windows Defender, AMSI and AppLocker."   | Complete| https://training.zeropointsecurity.co.uk/courses/red-team-ops |
